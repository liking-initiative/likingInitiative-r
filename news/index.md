# Changelog

## likingInitiative 0.2.1

- A pinned `version =` now downloads that version’s files. Previously
  the version label was honoured in the cache path but the newest
  release’s files were fetched, which would have silently drifted once a
  newer release existed.
- Unknown versions fail with the list of published versions.
- `citation("likingInitiative")` returns the database citation with its
  DOI.
- Package metadata points at the `liking-initiative` organization; the
  test suite honours `LIKING_INITIATIVE_RELEASE_DIR` outside the
  monorepo and skips cleanly when no release is available.

## likingInitiative 0.2.0

- Assets are fetched from Zenodo, so the package works without
  credentials. `latest` follows the concept DOI
  (10.5281/zenodo.22216442) and needs no package update when a new
  version is published.
- Transient Zenodo statuses (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) are retried with
  backoff.
- [`cite()`](https://liking-initiative.github.io/likingInitiative-r/reference/cite.md)
  returns the database citation with its DOI.
- Six datasets carry repeated rating phases as `timepoint`;
  [`get_item()`](https://liking-initiative.github.io/likingInitiative-r/reference/get_item.md)
  uses each dataset’s first phase.

## likingInitiative 0.1.0

- First release: catalogue listings,
  [`get_dataset()`](https://liking-initiative.github.io/likingInitiative-r/reference/get_dataset.md),
  [`get_item()`](https://liking-initiative.github.io/likingInitiative-r/reference/get_item.md),
  [`load_database()`](https://liking-initiative.github.io/likingInitiative-r/reference/load_database.md),
  citations, and a local asset cache, all backed by versioned release
  files rather than the live API.
